i am talking about why we should help drug addicts .


1. Drug users already go through a lot while their loved ones are trying to get them help;
 it would make it a lot easier for them to know their family and friends are with them trying to get them to help 
 rather than thinking they are against them and punishing them. 

2. Help them, help themselves.
 Be positive and kind and understanding not mean .
 Do everything you can do be compassionate and be respectful

3. People with drug addictions are not necessarily bad people;
   It's their form of escape from reality.
Many people who use drugs,because of various events in their life,
   like some circumstances at home or anxiety or depression and mental illness.
 sooo for sure they need the support and assistance not punishments.....

5.  like us they are also humans and they also  need help, care and empathy, not the punishment .
